    Displays the distribution of wine prices, filtering values up to the 0.9 decile.

    This function filters the wine prices to show only those that are less than or equal to a threshold
    (the 0.9 decile, in this case, 65). It then displays a price distribution chart using a histogram
    with a probability density estimate (KDE).

    Arguments:
    df (pd.DataFrame): A Pandas DataFrame that must contain the 'price' column, which represents the price of the wines.

    Returns:
    None: The function does not return anything, but generates a distribution chart displayed in a Streamlit app.
